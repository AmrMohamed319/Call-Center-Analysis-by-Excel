## Analysis
### Call Volume
Call volume is consistent throughout the month with a significant drop on the last day, potentially due to an anomaly or system issue.

### Satisfaction and Duration
* The average satisfaction score of 5.5 out of 10 is relatively low.
* An average call duration of 25.02 minutes indicates complex issues or inefficiencies.
### Channel Utilization
The majority of calls are handled via the call center (32%), followed by the chatbot (25%), showing good adoption of automated systems but a reliance on human agents.

### Geographical Distribution
High call volumes from Texas and California suggest larger customer bases or more prevalent issues in these states.

### Reason for Calls
Billing questions dominate the reasons for calls, indicating a need for better billing clarity or automation. Payments and service outages also contribute significantly.

### Response Times
Most calls are handled within SLA, indicating good performance. However, there is room for improvement for calls below and above SLA.

This project provides valuable insights into the call center's performance, helping identify areas for optimization to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
